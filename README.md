# BeRightBack
Where's the wait sign when you need it? For instance during a remote call, when you have to step back... or when you are waiting for all the participants to join. This mini-website simply pulls a random picture from Giphy.com with the search terms you entered and displays it on the website. If you don't like it, pull another one!
